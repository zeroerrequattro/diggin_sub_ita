there was something
very futuristic about it

180
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,000
I guess because it was very techno.

I think people who liked old club music
will listen to this

and think "Ah Soul II Soul and Enigma".

This kind of subtle, swinging beat

192
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,792
wasn't in any Japanese music back then,

193
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,140
and, of course,
it wasn't in any game music.

194
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,640
I could make the same kind of sounds
with FM synthesis.

Not only with FM synthesis,
but with a 1ch PCM too.

For example, among the famous
Roland instruments,

197
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,290
there were the TR-909 
and the TR-808 drum machines.

198
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,650
I sampled those sounds
and put together a beat.

When we did Streets of Rage,

203
00:12:49,10 --> 00:12:53,896
it was around the time the Genesis
started selling very strongly

204
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,973
in North America and Europe.

205
00:12:55,974 --> 00:13:00,632
Club music was growing in popularity
overseas at the time.

206
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:05,69
I believed people loved club music,

207
00:13:05,70 --> 00:13:08,303
so I thought if I could put this
into game music,

208
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:11,496
then they'd be really happy.

209
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:14,329
And I made the bold decision to give
 Streets of Rage

210
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,854
a house or techno kind of sound.

213

But I don't think he grew up in Japan,
I think he grew up in Detroit.

when it came it like, to dance music.

218
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:37,000
The thing about his work was
that it was very fresh.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Even if he was being inspired by 
what was actually happening in the clubs.

220
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,460
He made it,
he somehow technologically made it possible

221
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,700
to insert that into a video game.

222
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,000

223
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,000

were records I could've played,
