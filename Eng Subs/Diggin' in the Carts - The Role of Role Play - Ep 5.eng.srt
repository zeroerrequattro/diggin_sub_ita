played more in our households

6

growing up than any other form
of music at the time.

these timeless melodies remain faceless.

My flat was just a small room,

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,100
but every night,
people with different dreams

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,881
people who wanted to be painters, writers,

That kind of thing was happening
every night at my place.

54
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:16,274
And one day there was a girl who said

55
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,575
she was making games.

56
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:22,582
She asked me if
I could make tracks to be used in games,

57
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:25,479
and the place she ended up
taking me to was SQUARE.

called Prelude.

60
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,385
Around the time I worked on that,

61
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:46,159
I’d just finished making all the music
and thought everything was complete.

62
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,421
Then the boss suddenly came into the room

63
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:53,335
and told me to make one more song
for the opening screen.

64
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,856
He gave me only 30 minutes.

to create music on

70

I think that the more limited people are
the more ingenious they begin to get,

72
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,799
so maybe I actually enjoyed thinking

73
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,409
about how I could make rock music
with 3 sounds

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,493

classical sounding music.

00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:28,431
to attend a concert with his music
performed by an orchestra.

173
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:32,192
He was, I think, quite amazed to see

174
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:34,974
that an European orchestra
was performing his music.

175
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,839
And there were many fans
also asking for autographs.

three pieces.

Basically, there is the Symphonic Poem
based on Final Fantasy VI,

and then a piano concerto
based on the themes of Final Fantasy X,

with this concert

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,913
is that the audience really have
