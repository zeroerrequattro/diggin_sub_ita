Back then, composing was a suprisingly tough job

185
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,289
When a new title came up
I doubted if I could do it

186
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,348
It was always in my mind
that I'd written this kind of song before

187
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:07,477
so now I had to go one better.

188
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:10,396
Those doubts started to consume me

189
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:13,376
Back then, I had no idea of
what people thought about my music

190
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,478
no feedback from

191
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,886
the people who listened were given

192
00:14:19,48 --> 00:14:23,25
Maybe that's one of the reasons I ended up quitting

Maybe four or five years ago on YouTube

195
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,579
I saw a group living in New York

196
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,887
who perform Bit Music live

197
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:40,33
and they'd played a few songs from my Gimmick!

198
00:14:40,33 --> 00:14:43,878
They all knew the Gimmick! Music

199
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:48,203
and said it influenced them a lot

200
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,856
It made me really happy to hear that

201
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,829
Even though I quit music about 20 years ago

202
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,674
it made me feel like getting back into it

203
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,477
Receiving this kind of praise

204
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:05,625
makes me really happy

205
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:10,641
and I think it even encouraged me
to get back into music

206
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm really grateful
