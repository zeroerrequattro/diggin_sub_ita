hear their product that many of the same
musical influences

118
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,590
so we constantly are talking back and
forth about these things

119
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,650
I'll never forget the first year I was
doing something dear friends cancers and

120
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,640
came out to one of them

121
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,10

rehearsal and

122
00:09:27,10 --> 00:09:30,350

I hear Jimi Hendrix Purple Haze

125
00:09:37,20 --> 00:09:44,20
his that's what I was thinking up when I
wrote this

126
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,310
overwhelmingly the concert feels

127
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,529
like a a beautiful family gathering

128
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,269
up everyone single-mindedly loves Final
Fantasy music and wants to be there for

129
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:02,920
that reason

130
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,920
so it's very embracing up there was some
sitting in the audience with us

131
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,490
there's a lot of electricity right from
the beginning

132
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,529
there are some themes

133
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,430
that go back to choke about themore
Eunos some these very early themes

134
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,000
that are still in use today maybe 50 or
100 variations later

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but we see the same fanatical response
to those themes

136
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,360
some things that he attempted were
outrageously difficult that them to deal

137
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,550
with this computer chip Olympic
character

138
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,130
how to inject emotion and fear

139
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,990
drama you know into it and he was able
to do with music and that can translate

140
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,779
that wanted full orchestration

141
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,779
is also a testament to the way he wrote
