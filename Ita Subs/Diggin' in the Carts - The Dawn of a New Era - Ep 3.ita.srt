186
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:19,956
For Blanka's song, 
the rhythm like "tan ta ta",

187
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:24,429
the "taka tan tan" kind of rhythm
came to me really quickly.

188
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,760
The rhythm was basically done,

189
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,611
but I couldn't come up with a melody
even late in development.

190
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,497
So one morning on a commuter train
I was thinking, 


191
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:40,111
if I didn't finish Blanka's song
I wouldn't make the deadline.

192
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:43,656
I was thinking about Blanka on a train.

193
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:48,516
I was standing near the door,
and there was the rack on the top,

194
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:51,291
there was a greenish yellow paper bag
on top of that.

195
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:55,617
As soon as I saw it,
I thought about Blanka's colour

196
00:12:55,617 --> 00:13:00,275
the melody just came
into my head like that.

197
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,288
"Tararirarin" was in my head and I thought,

198
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,79
"This is it!"

199
00:13:05,79 --> 00:13:08,676
After that I was humming
"tararirarin, tararirarin"

200
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:11,71
humming it the whole time
while walking to work,

201
00:13:11,71 --> 00:13:12,825
and I said Good Mornin',

202
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,979
then went straight to my seat
to write down the tararirarin,

203
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,413
That's the Blanka's theme.

204
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:19,599
I can only thank
the paper bag on the train.

the kids from the neighbourhood
would come in from outside
